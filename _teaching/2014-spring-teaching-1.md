### 🧑‍🏫 Teaching Assistant  
**CSCI 1170-006: Computer Science I**  
*Middle Tennessee State University — Spring 2025*

As a teaching assistant for this 4-credit foundational programming course, I supported instruction in core principles of structured software development using the Python programming language. The course emphasized problem-solving through functional decomposition, algorithm design, and the use of simple data structures such as strings and lists. I assisted students in understanding key programming constructs, debugging techniques, and the use of UNIX tools for program execution and development. My role involved reinforcing concepts of procedural abstraction, guiding students through lab exercises, and supporting their progress in developing readable, well-documented, and logically structured Python programs.
