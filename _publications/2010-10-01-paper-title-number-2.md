excerpt: "This paper provides an in-depth review of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework, tracing its complete evolution from YOLOv1 to YOLOv11. It focuses on how YOLO has transformed from a simple real-time object detector into a robust, adaptable architecture suited for a wide range of applications. The authors begin by describing the motivation behind YOLO’s development—its core goal of achieving high-speed detection while maintaining accuracy. As the paper progresses, each version of YOLO is explained with its key innovations, such as the introduction of anchor boxes in YOLOv2, residual blocks in YOLOv3, and training optimizations in YOLOv4 and YOLOv5. YOLOv6 through YOLOv11 further emphasize improvements in inference speed, deployment efficiency, and industrial readiness. The review also discusses the divergence between official YOLO releases and community-developed versions like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, acknowledging their distinct design philosophies.
The paper systematically presents the architectural changes across versions, analyzing improvements in detection accuracy, computational complexity, training strategies, and model size. It explores how YOLO-based models are being adapted for domain-specific tasks by incorporating lightweight backbones, Transformer modules, and anchor-free strategies. A large portion of the review is devoted to benchmarking and comparing YOLO variants on popular datasets like COCO and Pascal VOC, as well as real-time performance metrics. The paper then highlights the broad range of YOLO applications, including medical diagnostics (e.g., tumor detection), agriculture (e.g., crop disease identification), autonomous vehicles (e.g., pedestrian tracking), surveillance systems, and industrial robotics. Ethical concerns such as bias, data privacy, and model misuse are also briefly addressed, acknowledging the growing importance of responsible AI."
